# Final Fantasy Codex

### By Qasim Hussain

## Description

Final Fantasy Codex is an online, fully responsive interactive encyclopedia of every character in the mainline Final Fantasy video game series entries 6-15. Built in React and utlizing the [Moogle API](https://www.moogleapi.com/), this front-end application allows you to browse through every character in the series from VI to XV, learning their backstory, age, first appearence and much more. The user can also use the search feature to browse for specific characters by name.

This project was degined and built for my front-end development portfolio. As a long time fan of the Final Fantasy series, I wanted to create something truly unique and personal to me for my first portfolio piece.

## Planning and Preperation

The inial preparation for this applicaion involved creating a flowchart and moodboard in Figma. This gave me a good idea of the funcionality I would need as well some visual reference for the overall look of the application.

The next step was to create a series of transparent PNG assets that I could use in my applicaion. aI wanted to randomly generate various Final Fnatasy characters as a background for the application on every refresh. Coming from an illustration and artwork background, I was able to paint out the backgrounds on various official character posters and convert them to transparent PNGs. This gave me an asset sheet that would be perfect for my application.

I also desiogned and created a banner for the application:

I then went into Figma and created a series of mock designs so I could figure out the visual design, flow and fuctionality of the applicaion before I began the build. I created a mock up of the homepage, character display page and the modal page. I did the same for mobile as I knew I wanted this application to be fully responsive. This process gave me  clarity on the design and style of the application before I even wrote a line of code.

The next step was to start coding and building the application. Due to the single page and reactive nature of the application I wanted to build, I knew the React library would be ideal for this project.
